# School Attendance Management System (Time-Series Analysis)

## Project Overview
This project implements a **School Attendance Management System** using digital tools to record, analyze, and visualize student attendance data.  
The system focuses on **time-series analysis** of attendance records and demonstrates the use of **Google Sheets, DBMS (SQL), Overleaf (LaTeX), Canva**, and **GitHub**.

---

## Objectives
- Maintain student attendance records digitally
- Analyze attendance trends over time (time-series analysis)
- Design a database schema using DBMS concepts
- Visualize attendance data using charts
- Document the project professionally

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Google Sheets** – Dataset creation & analysis
- **DB Fiddle (MySQL)** – Database schema & SQL queries
- **Canva** – System architecture and diagrams
- **Overleaf (LaTeX)** – Project report & documentation
- **GitHub** – Version control & project submission

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains **20 student records** with the following attributes:

| Column Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Student ID | Unique student identifier |
| Student Name | Name of student |
| Class | Class name |
| Date | Attendance date |
| Attendance Status | Present / Absent |
| Attendance Value | 1 = Present, 0 = Absent |

---

## Time-Series Analysis
- Attendance data is recorded across multiple dates
- Daily total attendance is calculated
- Trends are visualized using charts (Line / Pie charts)
- Helps identify attendance patterns over time

---

## Database Design (DBMS)
### Tables:
1. **Students**
2. **Attendance**

### Key Features:
- Primary & foreign keys
- One-to-many relationship
- SQL queries for:
  - Daily attendance
  - Student-wise attendance
  - Present/Absent analysis

---

## Data Visualization
- Pie chart for present vs absent students
- Time-series chart for daily attendance trends

---

## Documentation
- Project report written in **LaTeX** using Overleaf
- Includes:
  - Introduction
  - Dataset
  - Time-series analysis
  - SQL queries
  - References (via Mendeley)

---

## References
References are managed using **Mendeley** and included in the report using BibTeX.
